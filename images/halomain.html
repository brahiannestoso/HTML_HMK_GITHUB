These rings were designed as weapons of last resort to combat the parasitic Flood. The Flood is a terrifying alien species that infects and takes over other life forms. When activated, the Halo rings emit a pulse that eradicates all sentient life in the galaxy, starving the Flood of potential hosts. The Halo rings also serve as research facilities and habitats, showcasing the Forerunners' advanced technology and architectural prowess. The discovery of these rings by humanity and the Covenant sets the stage for the epic battles and alliances that define the Halo series. The Halo rings are not just weapons but also symbols of the ancient and powerful civilizations that once existed in the galaxy</li>
